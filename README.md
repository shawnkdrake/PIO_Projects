# PIO_Projects
This is a restart in an ongoing attempt at understanding the inter-relationship between programming with the Platformio IDE and Github integration. It is an ongoing evolution to how to do the basic tasks that many take forgranted. I certainly don't mind if you think it is a bit rudimentary as we all had to learn one way or another.

Cheers.
